I came across the scene at night -
The headlights beaming in an arc,
To shine upon the nightmare sight;
To free the shadows from the dark.
They lay there, cold as ice and still,
As frozen life; as graveyard air.
I slowed the car and felt the chill,
Of deepest night: of strangers' stare.
And even now - though years have passed -
If I should close my eyes I'd see,
A thousand shadows darkly massed,
To claim what's there's to take... for me.
For though I fled, and live to tell,
The story of the death I'm owed;
I'll say before my last farewell,
Just this... beware the canyon road.
