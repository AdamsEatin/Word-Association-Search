This world is a funny world indeed
And people are hard to suit
The man who plays the picollo 
Is a bore to the man with the flute
And often to myself i've thought how lovely it would be
If every person I ever met would simply agree with me

But since they wont
I think the way to make the whole world bright 
Is never to mind what others say
And do what I think is right.
